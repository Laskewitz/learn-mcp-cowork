# 📚 Learn for Copilot Cowork

A [Cowork](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/cowork/cowork-manage-plugins) plugin that connects to the [Microsoft Learn MCP Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/support/mcp) and includes a research skill for deep-diving into Microsoft documentation.

## 🧠 About the Microsoft Learn MCP Server

The [Microsoft Learn MCP Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/support/mcp) gives AI agents access to Microsoft's official documentation. It's a remote MCP server using Streamable HTTP — no authentication required, free to use.

**What it can do:**
